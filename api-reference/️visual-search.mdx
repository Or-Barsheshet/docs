description: Learn how to search for visually similar media using an uploaded image as the query.

<Card title="How This Helps" icon="lightbulb">
  Visual Search lets you upload an external image and use it to find similar content within your dataset. This helps surface lookalikes, variations, or duplicates based on visual similarityâ€”not just metadata.
</Card>

---

## Step 1: Upload an Image for Search

To begin, upload the query image using this endpoint:

```http
POST /api/v1/dataset/{dataset-id}/search-image-similarity?entity_type=IMAGES&bounding_box=X,Y,WIDTH,HEIGHT
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

### Request Parameters

- `file`: The image file to use for similarity search  
- `bounding_box` (optional): X, Y, Width, Height (if you're targeting a region)

---

## Step 2: Explore Similar Images

Once your query is uploaded and processed, use the returned `anchor_media_id` to explore visually similar results:

```http
GET /api/v1/explore/{dataset-id}?threshold=0&anchor_type={anchor_type}&entity_type={ENTITY_TYPE}&page_number={PAGE_NUMBER}&anchor_media_id={anchor_media_id}
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

### Parameters

- `ENTITY_TYPE`: `IMAGES` or `OBJECTS`  
- `anchor_media_id`: Retrieved from the upload response  
- `anchor_type`: Type returned with the media ID  
- `PAGE_NUMBER`: Which page of results to view (e.g., `0` for start)

---

### Example

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt>" \
  https://app.visual-layer.com/api/v1/explore/{dataset-id}?threshold=0&entity_type=IMAGES&page_number=0&anchor_media_id={anchor_media_id}
```

**Response:** Returns a list of Visual Layer image clusters that are visually similar to the uploaded image.
