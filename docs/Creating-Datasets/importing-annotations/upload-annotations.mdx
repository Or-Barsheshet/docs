## What Are Annotations?

Annotations are metadata labels that describe and categorize images or objects within images. They help structure visual datasets, making them searchable, analyzable, and useful for AI training.

## Common annotation types:

- **Image Annotations:** Assign class labels to entire images, helping categorize datasets.
- **Object Annotations:** Label individual objects within images using bounding boxes, improving model accuracy.

## Why Are Annotations Important?

Annotations play a critical role in machine learning and AI model training by:  
✔ Improving data organization for easier retrieval and filtering  
✔ Enhancing search-ability within datasets  
✔ Supporting object detection and classification tasks  
✔ Increasing model accuracy with high-quality labeled data

## Supported Annotation Formats

1. **Parquet / CSV**
2. **JSON (COCO format)**

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Important:** Annotations must be added when creating a dataset. Currently, you cannot add them afterward.
- Your annotation file must be named exactly as one of the following:
  - `annotations.json`
  - `image_annotations.csv`
  - `object_annotations.csv`
  - `image_annotations.parquet`
  - `object_annotations.parquet`
