>  **Note:** Annotations must be uploaded when creating a dataset and cannot be added later. See Creating a Dataset for more details.

For file structuring guidelines, visit[ Preparing Annotation Files.](<>)

## Supported Annotation Formats

1. **Parquet / CSV**
2. **JSON (COCO format)**

**Important:** 

- Annotations **must be added when creating a dataset**. Currently, you cannot add them afterward.
- Your annotation file must be named **exactly** as one of the following:
  - `annotations.json`
  - `image_annotations.csv`
  - `object_annotations.csv`
  - `image_annotations.parquet`
  - `object_annotations.parquet`  
    **Why is file naming important?** Annotation files must follow a strict naming convention to ensure proper recognition by Visual Layer. Files that do not match these names **will not be processed correctly.**

## How to Import Annotations

1. Upload your annotation file **during dataset creation** (see [Creating a Dataset](<>)).  
   Files can be uploaded from your **local machine** and **S3 bucket**.
2. Ensure that your file follows the **required format** and has the correct name (see [Preparing Annotation Files](<>)).
