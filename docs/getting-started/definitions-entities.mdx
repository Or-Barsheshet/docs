This glossary provides definitions and explanations for key terms and entities relevant to Visual Layer. Use it as a quick reference to understand the platform's core concepts and features.

### <span id="annotations">**Annotations** </span> 
Descriptive metadata or markers added to images or objects, such as bounding boxes or class labels, to enhance dataset usability.

### <span id="bounding-box">**Bounding Box** </span>  
A shape annotation drawn around an object in an image to define its position and size for object detection tasks.

### <span id="cluster">**Cluster** </span>  
A set of data entities grouped by a common characteristic. Images are grouped by a sophisticated similarity algorithm.

### <span id="cluster-view">**Cluster View** </span>  
A structured interface that visually presents groups of similar images, allowing users to explore related data efficiently.

### <span id="dataset">**Dataset** </span>  
A collection of visual data, such as images or videos, that users upload to Visual Layer for organization, exploration, and analysis.

### <span id="dataset-analysis">**Dataset Analysis** </span>  
A process in which the images in a given dataset are tested for possible issues from the known issue types and are grouped together for easy visualization. The result of the analysis is zero or more issues and zero or more Clusters.

### <span id="dataset-exploration">**Dataset Exploration** </span>  
The process of browsing, filtering, and searching through dataset contents, typically for data selection or inspection.

### <span id="dataset-exploration-view">**Dataset Exploration View** </span>
The primary view for exploring and analyzing a dataset. It provides access to images, objects, clusters, metadata filters, and search tools.

### <span id="dataset-inventory">**Dataset Inventory** </span> 
An overview of all available datasets in your Visual Layer environment.

### <span id="duplicates">**Duplicates** </span>  
Identical or near-identical images or videos within a dataset. Identifying and removing duplicates improves data quality and prevents redundancy.

### <span id="filtering">**Filtering** </span>  
The process of reducing a set of items by applying conditions to metadata properties. Filters can be applied to the entire dataset, a cluster, or a similar images.

### <span id="enrichment">**Enrichment** </span>  
The process of adding metadata or attributes to dataset items to enhance their value. This includes annotations, tags, or external data sources.

### <span id="image">**Image** </span>  
A visual file (e.g., PNG, JPG, GIF) representing an object or scene. It can be an artifact, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture, that resembles a subject.

### <span id="image-view">**Image View** </span>  
Displays clusters of visually similar images across your dataset, enabling efficient visual browsing.

### <span id="issue">**Issue** </span>  
A concrete instance of an issue type, typically linked to one or more images (e.g., train/test leakage, duplicates, or data drift).

### <span id="issue-type">**Issue Type** </span>  
A predefined category of problem identified during dataset analysis. It generates issue instances based on specific patterns or anomalies.

### <span id="metadata">**Metadata** </span>  
Information associated with each visual item, such as filename, dimensions, timestamps, and user-defined tags. Crucial for organizing and filtering datasets.

### <span id="mislabel">**Mislabel** </span>  
An incorrect or inconsistent label applied to a dataset item. Detecting and correcting mislabels ensures dataset accuracy.

### <span id="object">**Object** </span>  
A region of interest within an image, usually representing an instance of a specific class (e.g., a face, vehicle, or product).

### <span id="object-view">**Object View** </span>  
Displays clusters of annotated or enriched objects grouped by visual similarity. This view focuses on object-level insights rather than whole images.

### <span id="outliers">**Outliers** </span>  
Data points that differ significantly from the rest of the dataset. Identifying outliers can improve data quality and uncover unique patterns.

### <span id="saved-views">**Saved View(s)** </span>  
Custom configurations of filters and sorting applied to a dataset. Saved Views allow users to revisit specific subsets of data and share them with collaborators.

### <span id="selected-items">**Selected Item(s)** </span>  
The image, object, or cluster a user selects to view in detail or perform an action on.

### <span id="semantic-search">**Semantic Search** </span>  
A search technique based on meaning and context rather than exact keyword matches, enabling more intuitive dataset queries.

### <span id="similarity-results">**Similarity Results** </span>  
Images or clusters that are visually similar to a selected item (the "vertex").

### <span id="similarity-search">**Similarity Search** </span>  
The process of finding visually similar images or clusters for a given query item.

### <span id="similarity-vertex">**Similarity Vertex** </span>  
The reference item (image, object, or cluster) used as the starting point for similarity search.

### <span id="user-tags">**User Tags** </span>  
Custom labels applied by users to annotate or categorize dataset items. Tags support better organization, search, and collaboration.

### <span id="video">**Video** </span>  
A media file containing a sequence of moving images. Videos are treated as datasets and can be analyzed frame-by-frame.

### <span id="video-frame">**Video Frame** </span>  
An individual still image extracted from a video sequence. Each frame can be analyzed or annotated independently.
