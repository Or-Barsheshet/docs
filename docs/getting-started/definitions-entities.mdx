This glossary provides definitions and explanations for key terms and entities relevant to Visual Layer. Use it as a quick reference to understand the platform's core concepts and features.

---

### **Annotations**  
Descriptive metadata or markers added to images or objects, such as bounding boxes or class labels, to enhance dataset usability.

### **Bounding Box**  
A shape annotation drawn around an object in an image to define its position and size for object detection tasks.

### **Cluster**  
A set of data entities grouped by a common characteristic. Images are grouped by a sophisticated similarity algorithm.

### **Cluster View**  
A structured interface that visually presents groups of similar images, allowing users to explore related data efficiently.

### **Dataset**  
A collection of visual data, such as images or videos, that users upload to Visual Layer for organization, exploration, and analysis.

### **Dataset Analysis**  
A process that tests images in a dataset for known issue types and groups them for easy visualization. Results may include issue instances and clusters.

### **Dataset Exploration**  
The process of browsing, filtering, and searching through dataset contents, typically for data selection or inspection.

### **Dataset Exploration View**  
The primary view for exploring and analyzing a dataset. It provides access to images, objects, clusters, metadata filters, and search tools.

### **Dataset Inventory**  
An overview of all available datasets in your Visual Layer environment.

### **Duplicates**  
Identical or near-identical images or videos within a dataset. Identifying and removing duplicates improves data quality and prevents redundancy.

### **Enrichment**  
The process of adding metadata or attributes to dataset items to enhance their value. This includes annotations, tags, or external data sources.

### **Filtering**  
The process of reducing a set of items by applying conditions to metadata properties. Filters can be applied to datasets, clusters, or groups of similar images.

### **Image**  
A visual file (e.g., PNG, JPG, GIF) representing an object or scene. In Visual Layer, images are the core unit of analysis and annotation.

### **Image View**  
Displays clusters of visually similar images across your dataset, enabling efficient visual browsing.

### **Issue**  
A concrete instance of an issue type, typically linked to one or more images (e.g., train/test leakage, duplicates, or data drift).

### **Issue Type**  
A predefined category of problem identified during dataset analysis. It generates issue instances based on specific patterns or anomalies.

### **Metadata**  
Information associated with each visual item, such as filename, dimensions, timestamps, and user-defined tags. Crucial for organizing and filtering datasets.

### **Mislabel**  
An incorrect or inconsistent label applied to a dataset item. Detecting and correcting mislabels ensures dataset accuracy.

### **Object**  
A region of interest within an image, usually representing an instance of a specific class (e.g., a face, vehicle, or product).

### **Object View**  
Displays clusters of annotated or enriched objects grouped by visual similarity. This view focuses on object-level insights rather than whole images.

### **Outliers**  
Data points that differ significantly from the rest of the dataset. Identifying outliers can improve data quality and uncover unique patterns.

### **Saved Views**  
Custom configurations of filters and sorting applied to a dataset. Saved Views allow users to revisit specific subsets of data and share them with collaborators.

### **Selected Item(s)**  
The image, object, or cluster a user selects to view in detail or perform an action on.

### **Semantic Search**  
A search technique based on meaning and context rather than exact keyword matches, enabling more intuitive dataset queries.

### **Similarity Results**  
Images or clusters that are visually similar to a selected item (the "vertex").

### **Similarity Search**  
The process of finding visually similar images or clusters for a given query item.

### **Similarity Vertex**  
The reference item (image, object, or cluster) used as the starting point for similarity search.

### **User Tags**  
Custom labels applied by users to annotate or categorize dataset items. Tags support better organization, search, and collaboration.

### **Video**  
A media file containing a sequence of moving images. Videos are treated as datasets and can be analyzed frame-by-frame.

### **Video Frame**  
An individual still image extracted from a video sequence. Each frame can be analyzed or annotated independently.
