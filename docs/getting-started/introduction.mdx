## What is Visual Layer?

Visual data is often disorganized, scattered, and contains poor-quality data, making it difficult to manage, maintain, and extract value from in its raw form.

Manual processes for handling and sorting large volumes of data are inefficient, expensive, error-prone, and outdated. Using such methods impacts businesses in time-to-market, service quality, maintaining competitive edge and costs.

Visual Layer is a platform designed to empower users to curate, manage, and analyze visual data at scale. 

By combining advanced filtering, visualization tools, and organizational features, Visual Layer transforms how teams work with complex datasets. It seamlessly integrates with your workflows to offer a centralized hub for exploring visual data and gaining actionable insights.
