In this section, we address common issues and provide troubleshooting tips to help you overcome obstacles. Additionally, we offer various support channels, including our community, product and documentation feedback, and direct contact with our dedicated support team, to assist you in resolving any issues you may face.

## Errors

Errors are problems that completely prevent the Dataset from being added. Datasets with Errors should always appear first in the Inventory, before other Datasets. The progress bar will be replaced with the message â€œError creating Dataset." Under this message, you will see a detailed explanation of what the problem was.

You can dismiss an Error, thus removing the failed Dataset card and the information associated with it.

### Possible Error Types

| Error Type                     | Impact                  | Suggested Mitigation                                                                 |

| File uploaded is corrupted     | Dataset creation fails | Ensure that the file was properly saved or exported from the original source. Verify that the file format is supported by our system. If possible, try uploading the file using a different format. |
| File is protected by password  | Dataset creation fails | Remove password protection from the compressed file and try again.                 |
| Dataset Image limitation exceeded | Dataset creation fails | Consider splitting the Dataset or only adding a subset of the Images in it.        |
| Dataset file size exceeded     | Dataset creation fails | Consider splitting the Dataset or changing the Image format in the Dataset.        |
| Internal server error          | Dataset creation fails | Try to create the Dataset again. Contact our support team if the problem persists. |

If any of the above problems persist, contact our support team for further assistance. Please provide any relevant details, such as the file type and any error messages you encountered.

## Warnings

Warnings are problems that allow the Dataset to be added but limit some of the functionality around it. In case of a Warning, the Dataset will be successfully created, and you will be presented with a Warning indication on the header within the Dataset details page. Hovering over this indication will show details of the Warning(s).

### Possible Warning Types

- Annotations were not in the expected format.
- Too many Objects in the Dataset (over 1M Objects).
