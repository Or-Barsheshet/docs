In this section, we address common issues and provide troubleshooting tips to help you overcome obstacles. Additionally, we offer various support channels, including our community, product and documentation feedback, and direct contact with our dedicated support team, to assist you in resolving any issues you may face.

## Errors

Errors are problems that completely prevent the Dataset from being added. Datasets with Errors should always appear first in the Inventory, before other Datasets. The progress bar will be replaced with the message â€œError creating Dataset." Under this message, you will see a detailed explanation of what the problem was. 

You can dismiss an Error, thus removing the failed Dataset card and the information associated with it.

Possible Error types:

If any of the above problems persist, contact our support team for further assistance. Please provide any relevant details, such as the file type and any error messages you encountered.

## Warnings

Warnings are problems that allow the Dataset to be added but limit some of the functionality around it. In case of a Warning, the Dataset will be successfully created, and you will be presented with a Warning indication on the header within the Dataset details page. Hovering over this indication will show details of the Warning(s).

Possible Warning types:

- Annotations were not in the expected format
- Too many Objects in the Dataset (over 1M Objects)
