## What Are Bright Images and Objects?

Bright images are overexposed visuals with elevated brightness levels that wash out details and distort colors. These typically occur due to excessive lighting, reflective surfaces, or misconfigured camera settings.

### Common Causes of Brightness Issues

- **Excessive lighting conditions:** Strong sunlight, intense indoor lighting, or flash can overexpose parts of an image.
- **Reflective surfaces:** Shiny objects like glass, metal, or water reflect excessive light and may create bright hotspots.
- **Camera settings:** A high ISO, wide aperture, or slow shutter speed can result in the image sensor capturing too much light.

## Why It Matters

<div className="integrations-table">

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Loss of detail** | Overexposure reduces contrast and texture, especially in highlights. |
| **Color distortion** | Washed-out areas may appear inaccurate or completely white, affecting labeling or recognition. |
| **Lower model performance** | Vision algorithms may struggle to detect or segment bright objects due to low edge visibility. |
| **Visual quality degradation** | In public-facing use cases, poor exposure impacts perceived quality and credibility. |

## How to Handle Bright Images with Visual Layer

Bright images can be detected using Visual Layer's automated **issue filters**, which help surface overexposed samples prior to training, export, or annotation.

### Recommended Actions

- **Adjust exposure or contrast:** Use post-processing tools to tone down brightness and recover details from highlights.
- **Use histogram-based techniques:** Apply histogram equalization or tone mapping to normalize pixel intensity distributions.
- **Filter or exclude extreme cases:** Visual Layer makes it easy to isolate bright images and either exclude or fix them before they reach downstream systems.

Improving brightness balance ensures your dataset retains visual clarity, maintains labeling accuracy, and supports better-performing models.
