Visual Layer provides two powerful methods for text-based search across your visual data:

- **Semantic Search** – Enables deep search by meaning and context, going beyond keywords or labels.
- **Caption Search** – Enables searching for images or objects using natural language descriptions based on their visual content.

Both approaches allow you to quickly locate relevant images and objects using intuitive textual queries—whether you're looking for items with specific tags, or exploring high-level visual concepts.

Use the links below to explore how each search method works and how to apply them effectively in your dataset:
