There are ** four distinct **methods to perform visual similarity searches:

**1. Similarity Search on a Cluster**

**2. Similarity Search on an Image/Object**

**3. Similarity Search using a Region of Interest**

**4. Similarity Search via Image Upload**

***

## 1. Similarity Search on a Cluster

To apply a Similarity Search on a Cluster, hover the Cluster that you're interested in and click on the "Find Similar" action at the bottom of the Card.

      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}

## 2. Similarity Search on an Image/Object

Whether you're in **Object View** or **Image View**, you can apply a Similarity Search to any item of interest.

### Option 1:

**From the Dataset Details Page:**

1. Click **on a Cluster**.
2. Hover over the Image or Object youâ€™re interested in and click the **"Find Similar"** button at the bottom of the card.

**The results will look like this:**

        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Option 2:

**In the Cluster Details Page, click an Image/Object: **

1. Click on a **specific Image or Object** to open the Image Details Page.
2. In the Image Details Page, click **"Find Similar",** then click the similarity icon at the center of the image.

**The results will look like this**:

        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]

### Option 3:

To apply Similarity Search to an Object within the Image, hover over its bounding bow and click the "Find Similar" icon

The results will look like this:

## 3. Similarity Search using a Region of Interest

You can also apply Similarity Search to a cropped portion of an imageâ€”known as a Region of Interest (ROI). This is useful for finding more instances of a specific object or pattern within the dataset.

**To perform a Region of Interest search:**

1. Navigate to an image that's of interest to you in the same way as you would in Option 1.
2. Click on "Find Similar".
3. Crop the image to highlight the Region of Interest you'd like to search for.
4. click the "Find Similar" icon again to initiate the search.  
   The results will look like this:

**The results will look like this**

## 4. Similarity Search via Image Upload

You can also search using an** external image** that isn't part of your dataset.

**To search via image upload:**

1. Click the "Find Similar" icon next to the search bar at the top of the Dataset Page.
2. Upload an image from your local machine. Youâ€™ll have the option to crop it before searching.
3. Visual Layer will return the most visually similar Clusters, Images, or Objects found in the dataset.

**The results will look like this**:
