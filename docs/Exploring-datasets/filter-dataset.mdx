title: Filter Dataset
description: Use filters to narrow down, explore, and manage your dataset more effectively. Filters can be applied based on labels, tags, objects, issues, and more.

<Card title="How this Helps" icon="lightbulb">
    Filtering helps you instantly surface relevant slices of your dataset — whether you're tracking mislabels, inspecting object classes, or exploring edge cases like blurry or low-light frames.
</Card>

Visual Layer provides a flexible filtering system powered by logical structures (**AND**, **OR**, **EXCLUDE**). You’ll build filters in the **Filter Menu**, define them in the **Query Modal**, and review or edit them in the **Query Panel**.

---

## Filter Menu

The Filter Menu is where you select filters to apply. It dynamically adapts to your dataset and the context of your view.

**Available filter types include:**

- Labels  
- Object Labels  
- User Tags  
- Captions  
- Duplicates  
- Mislabels  
- Outliers  
- Quality Issues (e.g., Blurry, Bright, Dark)  
- File Type (Image / Video)  
- Folder  

<Note>
The filters shown change depending on your current logic mode and view context.
</Note>

- In **AND logic**: Only filters relevant to the current view are displayed.
- In **OR logic**: Filters apply across the entire dataset.
- In **Exclude logic**: Filters remove matching items from your view.

---

## Query Modal

Each filter opens a **Query Modal**, where you can configure:

- **Condition:** e.g., IS, IS NOT, CONTAINS  
- **Input Value:** Dropdown, text field, slider, or checkbox

<Note>
Conditions and input options vary by filter type.
</Note>

---

## Query Panel

The Query Panel shows all active filters, grouped by logic rows:

- **AND Row** (default): All conditions must be true  
- **OR Row**: At least one condition must be true  
- **Exclude Row**: Items matching these conditions are hidden

You can:

- Reorder filters within rows  
- Drag filters between rows  
- Delete filters at any time

<Tip>
Some actions, such as **Find Similar** or **Select Uniques**, automatically add filters to the Exclude row.
</Tip>

## Advanced Features

<Card title="Select Uniques">
Automatically filters non-unique samples by adding them to the **Exclude** row.
</Card>

<Card title="Visual Similarity Logic">
Similarity-based filtering supports:

- **IS** → Include items visually similar to the anchor
- **IS NOT** → Exclude items similar to the anchor  
- You can drag the filter between rows to expand or narrow results.
</Card>

<Card title="Cluster Navigation vs Filtering">
Clusters are now fully decoupled from filters. You can **enter a cluster** to explore it **without** applying a filter based on that cluster.
</Card>
