Visual Layer provides a powerful, flexible filter system based on logical structures (AND, OR, EXCLUDE). Filters are managed through the **Filter Menu**, configured in the **Query Modal**, and displayed as **Query Tab**s in the **Query Panel**.

***

## Filter Menu

The Filter Menu is where you select filters to apply. Available options depend on your dataset and view context.

**Available Filters:**

- Labels
- Object Labels
- User Tags
- Captions
- Duplicates
- Mislabels
- Outliers
- Quality Issues (Blurry, Bright, Dark)
- File Type (Image/Video)
- Folder

> **The menu dynamically adapts based on the dataset and view.**

In AND logic: only filters relevant to the current view are shown.

In OR logic: filters apply to the entire dataset.

In Exclude logic: filters exclude data from the visible set.

***

## Query Modal

**Each filter opens a Query Modal, where you define:**

- Condition (e.g., IS, IS NOT, CONTAINS)
- Value Input (e.g., dropdown, text input, slider)

***

## Query Panel

The Query Panel displays all filters grouped by logic:

- AND Row (default): All conditions must be met.
- OR Row: At least one condition must match.
- Exclude Row: Items matching these conditions will be excluded.

You can reorder AND filters and remove any filter at any time.

> **Some actions like Find Similar or Select Uniques automatically create an Exclude tab.**

***

## Filter Logic & Behavior

### Supported Conditions

- IS / IS NOT
- IS ONE OF / IS NOT ONE OF
