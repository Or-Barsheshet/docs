## Caption Search Operators

### AND Operator

**Description**  
The AND operator is implied when typing a search query with terms separated by spaces.

**Usage**  
Include `AND` between the search terms or just leave a space. Uppercase or lowercase does not matter.

**Example**  
Searching for `black cat` in the search bar. The following queries are equivalent:

```text
black AND cat  
black and cat  
black + cat
```

**Result**  
This query will return images that contain both the terms "black" AND "cat" in any order.

### OR Operator

**Description**  
The OR operator is used to find results containing either one of the search terms or both.

**Usage**  
Include `OR` between the search terms. Uppercase or lowercase does not matter.

**Example**  

```text
black cat OR black dog  
black cat or black dog
```

**Result**  
This query will return images containing either black cats, black dogs, or both.

### NOT Operator

**Description**  
The NOT operator is used to exclude terms from the search results.

**Usage**  
Prefix the term you wish to exclude with a minus sign (`-`).

**Example**  

```text
dog -black
```

**Result**  
This query will return images with the term "dog" in the metadata but will exclude any images that also contain the term "black."

### Exact Match

**Description**  
For an exact match of a phrase or sequence of words, use quotation marks.

**Usage**  
Enclose the exact phrase within double quotes.

**Example**  

```text
"yellow flower"
```

**Result**  
This query will return images where the metadata exactly matches the phrase "yellow flower" and not a more generic search that also returns other images containing flowers or yellow objects.

It is also possible to combine the operators above.

**Example**  

```text
flower -bird OR tree AND "red leave"
```
