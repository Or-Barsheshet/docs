<Card title="How this Helps" icon="lightbulb">
  Caption Search allows you to query your dataset using natural language and logical operators. By refining how you search captions, you can surface specific data points, remove noise, and discover relevant content faster.

## Caption Search Operators

Visual Layer supports several search operators to help you build flexible, accurate caption queries. These include `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, exact match using quotes, and combinations of all of the above.

## AND Operator

The `AND` operator is implied when you separate terms with a space, or you can write it explicitly.

- **Usage**:  
  Use `AND`, `and`, or `+` between terms. Example:  
  `black AND cat`  
  `black and cat`  
  `black + cat`  
  `black cat`

- **Result**:  
  Returns captions that include both “black” and “cat” in any order.

## OR Operator

Use the `OR` operator to find results that contain either one term or the other—or both.

- **Usage**:  
  Use `OR` or `or` between terms. Example:  
  `black cat OR black dog`  
  `black cat or black dog`

- **Result**:  
  Returns images that mention “black cat,” “black dog,” or both.

## NOT Operator

Use the `NOT` operator to exclude terms from search results.

- **Usage**:  
  Prefix a word with a minus sign `-`. Example:  
  `dog -black`

- **Result**:  
  Returns captions that contain “dog” but exclude any that also include “black.”

## Exact Match

Wrap terms in double quotes to return captions that match the exact phrase.

- **Usage**:  
  Use double quotation marks `" "` around a phrase. Example:  
  `"yellow flower"`

- **Result**:  
  Returns captions with the exact phrase “yellow flower.”

## Combining Operators

You can combine operators to write more advanced queries.

- **Example**:  
  `flower -bird OR tree AND "red leave"`

- **Result**:  
  This query includes:  
  - Any caption that includes “flower” but not “bird”  
  - Or includes “tree”  
  - And must also include the exact phrase “red leave”

<Tip>
Use quotes and parentheses to group logic and ensure the query works as expected.
