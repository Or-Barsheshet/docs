## Caption Search Operators

### AND operator

- **Description**: The AND operator is implied when typing a search query with terms separated by spaces
- **Usage**: Include "AND" between the search terms or just leave a space. Uppercase or lowercase does not matter. 
- **Example**: Searching for black cat in the search bar. The following queries are equivalent

```Text Search query
black AND cat  
black and cat  
black + cat
```

- **Result**: This query will return images that contains both the terms "black" AND "cat" in any order.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/69b2c83-Screenshot_2024-06-05_at_10.56.55.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### OR operator

- **Description**: The OR operator is used to find results containing either one of the search terms or both
- **Usage**: Include "OR" between the search terms. Uppercase or lowercase does not matter
- **Example**: 

```Text Search query
black cat OR black dog
black cat or black dog
```

- **Result**: This query will return images containing either black cats, black dogs or both.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/88a1799-Screenshot_2024-06-05_at_11.02.05.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### NOT operator

- **Description**: The NOT operator is used to exclude terms from the search results
- **Usage**: Prefix the term you wish to exclude with a minus sign (-)
- **Example**: 

```Text Search query
dog -black
```

- **Result**: This query will return images with the term "black" in the metadata but will exclude any images that also contain the term "cat".

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/7a1fe3a-Screenshot_2024-06-05_at_11.11.35.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Exact match

- **Description**: For an exact match of a phrase or sequence of words, use quotation marks
- **Usage**: Enclose the exact phrase within double quotes
- **Example**: 

```
"yellow flower"
```

- **Result**: This query will return images where the metadata exactly matches the phrase "yellow flower" and not a more generic search which also returns other image which contain flowers or yellow objects

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/34b756c-Screenshot_2024-06-05_at_17.33.37.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


### Combining operators

It is also possible to combine the operators above eg

```Text Search query
flower -bird or tree and "red leave"
```
