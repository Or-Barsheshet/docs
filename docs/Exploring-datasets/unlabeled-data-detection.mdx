In large-scale datasets, detecting unclassified images and objects can be challenging. Visual Layer simplifies this process with just one click.

### Find unclassified data using a simple filter

1. Navigate to the [Dataset Inventory](https://dash.readme.com/project/visual-layer2/v1.0/docs/browsing-datasets) and select a dataset by clicking on it. 
2. Select the required view: Images view or [Objects](https://dash.readme.com/project/visual-layer2/v1.0/docs/understanding-and-exploring-objects) view. 
3. In the top filter bar, go to the "Labels" filter, select "Unlabeled," and apply the filter.

4. The returned results will consist of images or image clusters, objects, or object clusters that are unlabeled. 
5. Users can add unlabeled data to the "Selected Items" list, export it, and send it for classification/labeling.
