A powerful tool designed to automatically surface the most visually distinct examples in your dataset and **reduce redundancy**. This helps you focus on high-value, diverse contentâ€”making your** model training** more effective and your **data exploration** more meaningful and efficient.

***

## Use Cases

- **Reduce redundancy** before exporting or training
- **Generate compact datasets **by removing near-duplicates
- **Explore long tail** data that might otherwise be hidden among common examples

***

## How It Works

- Each image or object in your dataset is assigned a **uniqueness score**, ranging from `0` (not unique) to` 1` (highly unique).
- When activated, this filter excludes similar items based on your selected threshold, retaining only the most unique examples.
- This filtering action is added to the Exclude row in the Query Panel.

***

## How to Apply the Filter

- In the **Dataset Exploration View**, click the** Select Uniques button** (located next to the search bar).
- A **threshold slider** will appear, allowing you to choose the desired** level of uniqueness**.
- Once selected, the filter is applied and represented as a Query Tab under the Exclude section of the Query Panel.

***

## In the Export JSON

When exporting data with this filter applied, the remaining items will have relatively **high uniqueness scores**. You can find these scores in the` media_items` section:

```
"uniqueness_score": 0.9285714285714288
```
