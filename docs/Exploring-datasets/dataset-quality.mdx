title: "Dataset Quality"
description: ""
---
High-quality datasets are essential for training reliable and accurate machine learning models. Poor dataset quality—such as **blurry**, ** dark**, or ** overly bright**images—can significantly impact performance, leading to ** biased predictions, reduced model accuracy, and suboptimal decision-making**.

Identifying and addressing these quality issues ensures that datasets remain **clean, representative,** and **effective** for AI applications. Visual Layer provides **advanced tools** to **automatically** detect and manage dataset quality issues, helping users **streamline preprocessing, reduce errors, and optimize model training**.

This section explores common dataset quality issues and how to effectively mitigate them:
