## What Are Dark Images and Objects?

Dark images are underexposed visuals that lack sufficient brightness, making it difficult to interpret or extract visual details. They often appear dim, shadowed, or low-contrast—reducing both human and model-level interpretability.

### Common Causes of Darkness in Visual Data

- **Poor lighting conditions**: Capturing in low-light environments or scenes without adequate illumination leads to dark outputs.
- **Camera settings**: Improper settings like fast shutter speed, low ISO, or narrow aperture can result in underexposed images.
- **Scene characteristics**: Some subjects—like night scenes, shaded objects, or predominantly dark materials—naturally produce low-light imagery.

## Why It Matters

<div className="integrations-table">

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Visual ambiguity** | Annotators may miss important elements due to lack of detail or poor visibility. |
| **Model degradation** | Object detection and segmentation performance can drop significantly on low-exposure inputs. |
| **Poor user experience** | In public-facing applications, dark visuals can appear unpolished or unprofessional. |

## How to Handle Dark Images with Visual Layer

Dark images can be surfaced and reviewed using Visual Layer's built-in issue filters. Once identified, there are several paths forward depending on severity:

### Recommended Actions

- **Apply enhancement techniques**: Post-processing methods like brightness correction, histogram equalization, or contrast adjustment can make images more usable.
- **Retake with better lighting**: If feasible, recapture scenes with improved lighting conditions or camera calibration.
- **Filter out extreme cases**: Use Visual Layer filters to isolate and exclude images that fall below acceptable brightness thresholds before training or export.

By detecting and resolving dark visuals early, you can improve dataset quality, annotation accuracy, and model performance—especially in environments where lighting is a critical factor.
