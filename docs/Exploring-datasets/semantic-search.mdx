Semantic Search allows you to retrieve images and objects based on the **meaning and context** of your textual queriesâ€”rather than relying solely on exact keyword matches. This enables more **intuitive**, **concept-driven** searches, helping you uncover results that are relevant but might otherwise be missed by traditional search techniques.

By leveraging metadata generated by models such as `VL-Image Semantic Search` or `VL-Object Semantic Search`, Visual Layer can understand and **match natural language** queries with your visual data.

***

## How It Works

- Semantic Search uses **enrichment-generated metadata** to match your search terms with visual or contextual concepts in your dataset.- run VL-Image Semantic Search, or VL-Object Semantic Search. 
- **Supports both image-level and object-level** semantic queries, depending on which models were run and what view you stand on (image or object view).
- **Ideal for discovering patterns**, exploring concepts, or quickly navigating large datasets without knowing specific keywords in advance.

***

## Example Queries

- **Simple Query:** "sunset over mountains"
- **Detailed Query:** "bright sunset over rocky mountains with clear sky"
- **Combined Attributes:** "blue sports car on city street at night"
