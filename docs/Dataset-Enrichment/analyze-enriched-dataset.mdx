title: Analyze enriched dataset
description: Learn how to explore, search, and export your enriched metadata using Visual Layer tools.
---


Once your dataset has been enriched using Visual Layer’s AI models, you can begin analyzing the generated metadata to surface patterns, identify issues, and prepare the dataset for export, training, or delivery.

Use the tools below to take full advantage of your enriched data.
## Search with Semantic Models

Use [Semantic Search](/docs/semantic-search) to explore your dataset using **natural language queries**.

### Common use cases:
- Search for visual concepts (e.g., “sunset over forest”)
- Find fine-grained differences across scenes
- Match by meaning, not just tags

---

## Filter by Issues

Detect and isolate problematic data using Visual Layer’s automated filters:

- [Mislabels](/docs/mislabels)
- [Duplicates](/docs/duplicates)
- [Outliers](/docs/outliers)
- [Unlabeled Items](/docs/unlabelled)

These tools help you clean your dataset quickly and improve downstream performance.

## Use Captions & Tags

Explore model-generated metadata such as:

- **Captions** for entire images
- **Tags** and labels for quick filtering
- **Descriptions** of objects or scenes

Use [Caption Search](/docs/caption-search) or [User Tags](/docs/data-selection-using-visual-layer) to filter and organize your enriched data more effectively.

---

## Export Enriched Data

Use the [Export tool](/docs/export-dataset) to download either the full dataset or a filtered subset.

### Included in the export:
- Model-generated labels
- Captions and tags
- Object metadata and annotations

All exported data is formatted in clean, structured JSON.
