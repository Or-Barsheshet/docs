Once your dataset has been enriched with metadata using Visual Layerâ€™s AI models, you can begin to analyze, query, and act on that metadata to uncover valuable insights. This section outlines how to make the most of your enriched data.

## What You Can Do Next

Use the following tools and views to explore and analyze the metadata:

1. **[Search with Semantic Models:](https://dash.readme.com/project/visual-layer2/v1.0/docs/semantic-search)**  
   Use semantic search to find images or objects based on concepts.
2. **[Filter by Issues:](https://dash.readme.com/project/visual-layer2/v1.0/docs/overview-1)**  
   Automatically identify problems like mislabels, duplicates, and outliersâ€”and fix them quickly.
3. **[Use Captions & Tags](https://dash.readme.com/project/visual-layer2/v1.0/docs/textually-searching-for-data-copy)**  
   Review and filter based on model-generated captions, tags, or label descriptions.
4. **[Export Enriched Data](https://dash.readme.com/project/visual-layer2/v1.0/docs/export-dataset)**  
   Export enriched metadata in JSON format, with options for filtered subsets or the full dataset.
