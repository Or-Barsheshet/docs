`LOG_LEVEL`

**Description**: Controls how verbose the logging system is. Useful for debugging or reducing noise in production.

**Accepted Values:**

`DEBUG`

`INFO` (default)

`WARNING`

`ERROR`

`CRITICAL`

Example:

```c bash
python main.py --LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

At `DEBUG`, additional internal processing messages will be logged, including more detailed diagnostics (e.g., when log level is set to 10 extra diagnostic info is shown).

***

`SWAP_RGB_CHANNELS_FOR_TIFF_HEIC`

**Description:** Corrects color rendering issues that can occur in certain TIFF and HEIC image formats, where red and blue channels may appear reversed.

**Behavior: ** When enabled, the red and blue color channels are swapped while green remains unchanged. This ensures that images are displayed using the expected RGB format across all systems.

Example:

```c bash
python main.py --SWAP_RGB_CHANNELS_FOR_TIFF_HEIC=true
```
