# Overview

For visualizing the results or individual parts of the analysis, fastdup generates galleries in the form of `HTML` files that are saved to the `galleries` sub-dir of the work directory and presented interactively when using Jupyter notebooks. 

Starting from V1.0 galleries have a new layer of abstraction that automatically adds bounding boxes and labels to images where available.

## Gallery configuration

Galleries share a few methods and arguments used for visualizing labels and bounding boxes, and for setting general attributes:

- `slice`: Visualize a subset of the data with the given label, e.g., `slice='dog'`

- `sort_by`:  Sort images by a property, supported are:
  - default: `comp_size` - Number of images in the component
  - `distance` - The average distance between cluster members. Clusters where the images are most similar will be presented first
  - `area` - From the largest to the smallest image or bounding box average size

- `label_col`: Column to use as labels, common options are `label`, `split` and `img_filename`.

- `num_images`: (default=20) The number of images to visualize.

- `max_width`: (default=None) Pixel width of displayed gallery. Useful values are often in the 800-1200 range.

- `lazy_load`: (default=False) When `False`, images are embedded into the gallery `HTML` files. Otherwise images are loaded by the browser using their relative paths. Using `lazy_load` makes galleries lighter and faster to generate, but less portable and shareable. On the other hand, Without lazy loading galleries become very large files.

# Visualizing Images

For most cases, visualization is as simple as `fd.vis.component_gallery()`. The rest of the parameters are optional, and could be selected in hindsight. 

## Adding Labels

The `label_col`  argument controls the labels appended to each image visualized. By default it fetches labels from the label column in the annotations dataframes provided during the `fastdup.run()` call. When labels are not provided, or if the use of another column is desired, the `label_col` argument could be set for using the required column.
