# Installation and Setting Up

If you're running fastdup for the first time, we recommend to [run this tutorial on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/visual-layer/fastdup/blob/main/examples/quickstart.ipynb). 

Or if you're feeling adventurous, feel free to install on your machine and proceed. For a detailed list of installation options and supported platforms, see our [installation guide.](https://visual-layer.readme.io/docs/installation)

In most cases you can install fastdup with:

```bash
pip install fastdup
```

To verify the installation, run:

```python
import fastdup
fastdup.__version__
```

This should show the version of fastdup you've installed.

This tutorial runs on version `0.906`.

# Download a sample dataset

We'll use the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) which contains 7,300 images of cats and dogs from 37 breeds.

Let's download and unzip the images with:

```bash
wget https://thor.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/images.tar.gz
tar xvf images.tar.gz 
```

Once done you should end up with a folder `images/` in your root directory.

# Run fastdup

It only takes 3 lines of code to run fastdup:

```python
import fastdup
fd = fastdup.create(work_dir="fastdup_work_dir/", input_dir="images/")
fd.run()
```

> 📘 **Parameters for `fastdup.create`**
> 
> - `work_dir` - Path to store the artifacts generated from the run.
> - `input_dir` - Path to the images.

fastdup will start analyzing the dataset for potential issues. How long it takes to complete the run depends on your computing power. 

> 🚧 **Run time**
> 
> On Google Colab (free version with 2 CPU cores) it takes a little over 3 minutes to complete the run!

Once the run finishes, we can visualize all the issues found.

# Invalid Images

This is one of the most common issues with image datasets. The images could be broken or corrupted. fastdup keeps track of all invalid images it encounters during the run.

To view the details of the invalid images, simply run:

```python
fd.invalid_instances()
```

which outputs a `Pandas` `DataFrame`:

| img_filename        | fastdup_id | error_code          | is_valid |
|---------------------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| Abyssinian_34.jpg   | 135        | ERROR_ZERO_SIZE_FILE| False    |
| Egyptian_Mau_139.jpg| 2240       | ERROR_ZERO_SIZE_FILE| False    |
| Egyptian_Mau_145.jpg| 2247       | ERROR_ZERO_SIZE_FILE| False    |
| Egyptian_Mau_167.jpg| 2268       | ERROR_ZERO_SIZE_FILE| False    |
| Egyptian_Mau_177.jpg| 2278       | ERROR_ZERO_SIZE_FILE| False    |
| Egyptian_Mau_191.jpg| 2293       | ERROR_ZERO_SIZE_FILE| False    |

> 📘 **Something unexpected**
> 
> Broken images are something we did not expect to see, especially with a curated dataset like the Oxford IIT Pet Dataset. But this shows how easily you can detect them with fastdup with just one line of code.

# Duplicate Image Pairs

Let's now visualize if there are any duplicates with:

```python
fd.vis.duplicates_gallery()
```

which outputs:

![Duplicate Image Pairs](https://files.readme.io/0529bb4-_home_dnth_Downloads_duplicates.html.png)

> 📘 **Under the hood**
> 
> The above gallery shows duplicate pairs computed using the `cosine` distance. A distance of `1.0` indicates the image pair is an exact duplicate.
> 
> **TIP**: You can specify `num_images` as a parameter to `fd.vis.duplicates_gallery` to see more or fewer image pairs. For example: `fd.vis.duplicates_gallery(num_images=5)`

# Outliers

Similar to duplicate pairs, you can visualize potential outliers in your dataset with:

```python
fd.vis.outliers_gallery()
```

which outputs:

![Outliers](https://files.readme.io/9bfafc7-_home_dnth_Downloads_outliers.html.png)

> 📘 **Verify outliers**
> 
> As you can see, not all images in the outliers report are true outliers. The images appear on the report simply because they look different from other images in the dataset (distance-wise).
> 
> As a curator, you'd need to verify if they are true outliers by inspecting the report.

# Dark, Bright and Blurry Images

fastdup also lets you visualize images from your dataset using statistical metrics. 

For example, with `metric='dark'` we can visualize the darkest images from the dataset.

```python
fd.vis.stats_gallery(metric='dark')
```

which outputs:

![Dark Images](https://files.readme.io/cc4ef17-_home_dnth_Downloads_mean.html.png)

In contrast, `metric='bright'` populates the gallery with the brightest images on top.

```python
fd.vis.stats_gallery(metric='bright')
```

which outputs:

![Bright Images](https://files.readme.io/d6afe94-_home_dnth_Downloads_mean201.html.png)

Similarly, `metric='blur'` shows the blurriest images on top.

```python
fd.vis.stats_gallery(metric='blur')
```

which outputs:

![Blurry Images](https://files.readme.io/11f872c-_home_dnth_Downloads_blur.html.png)

> 📘 **Verify dark, bright and blurry images**
> 
> Again, we see that not all images in the statistical visualization gallery are problematic. As a curator, you'd need to verify and filter out the problematic images.
> 
> Since the Oxford Pets Dataset is a curated dataset, we'd not expect to find extremely bright, dark or blurry images.

# Image Clusters

One of fastdup's coolest features is visualizing image clusters. In the previous section, we saw how to visualize similar image pairs. In this section, we group similar-looking images (or even duplicates) as a cluster and visualize them in a gallery.

To do so, simply run:

```python
fd.vis.component_gallery()
```

which outputs:

![Image Clusters](https://files.readme.io/87cb580-_home_dnth_Downloads_components.html.png)

> 📘 **Term**
> 
> Clusters are known as 'components' in fastdup. You'd see the term 'component' used more frequently in code and documentation.

# Summary

So there you have it. With a few lines of code, you can quickly sift through thousands of images in your dataset for potential issues. Not to mention, you can run it just by using Google Colab, with limited compute resources!

> 👍 **TLDR**
> 
> In this tutorial we've seen how to use fastdup to find:
> 
> - Broken images.
> - Duplicate image pairs.
> - Outliers.
> - Dark, bright and blurry images.
> - Image clusters.

What to do about all the problematic images? You can decide to keep or eliminate them. Check out the next tutorial!
