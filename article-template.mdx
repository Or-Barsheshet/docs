<Card title="How this Helps" icon="lightbulb">
    This feature enables teams to streamline repetitive or manual tasks, reducing time spent on video review and dataset cleanup. It’s particularly valuable for computer vision teams managing large-scale video datasets across multiple environments.
</Card>

[Feature Name] allows users to [brief description of what this feature enables]. At Visual Layer, this is especially useful for [describe role, e.g., ML engineers or data scientists] looking to [solve a specific challenge, like identify duplicates, improve annotation quality, or prepare datasets for fine-tuning].

Common use cases include:
- [Use case 1]: [brief description]
- [Use case 2]: [brief description]
- [Use case 3]: [brief description]

# [Feature Architecture / How It Works]

The diagram below outlines the key components of this feature in Visual Layer:

</Frame>

Below is a breakdown of each component:

<div className="integrations-table">

|   | Component     | Description |
|---|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Triggers](/docs/[path-to-trigger-doc]) | Events or user actions that initiate the workflow or feature process. |
| 2 | [Steps](/docs/[path-to-steps]) | Sequential actions or evaluations taken on the video or image data. |
| 3 | [Flow Controls](/docs/[path-to-flow-controls]) | Logic that governs conditional execution of steps, such as filters or decision trees. |
| 4 | [Outputs](/docs/[path-to-outputs]) | Final outputs such as metadata exports, updated video versions, or metrics. |

<Tip>
You can use [Visual Layer Copilot](/docs/copilot) to accelerate the setup process and generate optimized flows automatically.

<Accordion title="Example I: Auto-Remove Blurry Frames Before Annotation" icon="memo-circle-info" iconType="solid" size={30}>
A computer vision team at ACME Robotics needs a pre-processing step that removes low-quality frames before the data is sent for labeling.

This process begins with an on-demand trigger that scans uploaded datasets. The system evaluates each frame for sharpness and flags blurry frames for exclusion. Once identified, those frames are automatically removed or isolated in a separate dataset version.

The result is a cleaner, more efficient annotation pipeline with higher training data quality and lower cost.

# Using [Feature Name]

With [Feature Name], you can:

- [action 1]
- [action 2]
- [action 3]
- [action 4]

## [First sub-heading — e.g., How It Works]

The following is an overview of how the process works:

<Steps>

<Step title="Upload your video dataset">
Upload a dataset using the Visual Layer UI or API. Once uploaded, the system will begin metadata indexing.

</Step>

<Step title="Enable frame quality checks">
Enable frame quality filters from the configuration panel.

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/frame-quality-ui.png" alt="Frame Quality UI Configuration" />
</Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Define thresholds for blur detection">
Set acceptable ranges for visual clarity, based on your project's needs.

</Step>

<Step title="Review flagged frames">
A preview set of flagged frames will be shown for validation. You can confirm removals or override false positives.

</Step>

<Step title="Commit clean dataset version">
Once validated, save the filtered dataset as a new version for downstream tasks like labeling or fine-tuning.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Recommendations and Limitations

- Works best on datasets larger than 500 frames
- Thresholds may need adjustment for infrared or thermal footage
- Currently supports `.mp4`, `.avi`, and `.mov` formats
- GPU-accelerated processing is only available on Enterprise plans
