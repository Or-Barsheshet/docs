This glossary provides definitions and explanations for the key terms and entities relevant to Visual Layer. Use this as a quick reference to understand the platform's core concepts and features.

**Annotations:** Descriptive metadata or markers added to images or objects, such as bounding boxes or class labels, to enhance dataset usability.

**Bounding Box:** A shape annotation drawn around an object in an image to define its position and size for object detection tasks.

**Cluster:** A set of data entities grouped by a common characteristic. Images are grouped by sophisticated similarity algorithm.

**Cluster view: ** A structured interface that visually presents groups of similar images, allowing users to explore related data efficiently.

**Dataset:** A collection of visual data, such as images or videos, that users upload to Visual Layer for organization, exploration, and analysis.

**Dataset Analysis:** A process in which the images in a given dataset are tested for possible issues from the known issue types and are grouped together for easy visualization. The result of the analysis is zero or more issues and zero or more Clusters.

**Dataset exploration:** The process of browsing, filtering and searching through the data in a Dataset, usually for data selection purposes.

**Dataset Exploration View:** The main view for browsing, filtering, and analyzing your dataset. It provides access to images, objects, clusters, metadata filters, and search tools.

**Dataset Inventory:**The overview of all available datasets

**Duplicates:** Identical or near-identical images or videos within a dataset. Identifying and removing duplicates ensures data quality and prevents redundancy in analyses.

**Enrichment:** The process of adding additional metadata or attributes to dataset items to enhance their value and utility. This can include annotations, tags, or external data sources.

**Filtering:** process of reduction of a set of items by applying conditions (query expression) to items metadata properties. Set of items can be anything: a cluster, entire dataset, similar images

**Image:** A file that contains a visual representation of something. for example, a GIF or PNG file. An image can be an artifact, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture, that resembles a subject.

**Image View:** Image View displays clusters of visually similar images across your dataset.

**Issue:** A concrete instance of an issue type, associated with one or more images (e.g. train/test leakage, cluster of duplicates, data drift).

**Issue Type:** A specific type of a problem that during the analysis process takes one or more images in and generates zero or more issue instances.

**Metadata:** Information associated with each visual data item, such as file name, dimensions, creation date, or user-defined attributes. Metadata plays a key role in filtering and organizing datasets.

**Mislabel:** An incorrect or inconsistent label applied to a dataset item. Identifying and correcting mislabels is crucial for maintaining dataset accuracy and reliability.

**Object:** A region of interest in an image, usually a region that contains an instance of a specific class.

**Object View:** Object View presents clusters of annotated or enriched objects, grouped by visual similarity. Rather than analyzing entire images, this view focuses on specific object instances—like faces, cars, animals, and more—allowing for detailed inspection and object-level insights.

**Outliers:** Data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset. Visual Layer enables users to identify and analyze outliers to improve data quality and gain insights.

**Saved Views:** Custom configurations of filters and sorting applied to a dataset. Saved Views allow users to easily revisit specific subsets of data and share them with collaborators.

**Selected item(s):** The item/s (Image, Cluster or Object) that user selects in order to see details about or perform an action on.

**Semantic Search:** A search technique that uses the meaning and context of terms rather than exact matches, enabling more intuitive and relevant results when querying datasets.

**Similarity Results:** Images and Clusters that are visually similar to a chosen Vertex

**Similarity Search:** The process of finding similar Images and/or Clusters for a given query Image or Cluster

**Similarity Vertex:** The item/s (Image, Cluster or Object) that user chooses to see its similar Images

**User tags:** User-defined labels applied to dataset items to categorize, group, or annotate specific data points. Tags enhance search-ability and organization.

**Video:** A file that contains the recording, reproducing, or broadcasting of moving visual images.

**Video Frame:** An individual image extracted from a video sequence. Each frame represents a single moment in time and can be analyzed or processed independently.
