- **Understanding Clusters** – Learn how images and objects are grouped based on similarity and how to interact with them.  
- **Entity Types: Images vs. Objects** – Understand the different views available: **Image View** and **Object View**.  
- **Images and Video Frames** – Explore how Visual Layer handles images and extracted video frames.

Managing large collections of images and videos can be time-consuming. To simplify exploration, Visual Layer automatically groups similar **images** and **Core Frames** from videos into **Clusters**. Clusters are structured based on the selected view—either as images or core frames in **Image View** or as objects in **Object View**.

Clusters allow you to efficiently:

- **Explore** and **filter** vast amounts of visual data.  
- **Tag** and **sort** images based on their similarities.  
- **Identify patterns** by grouping objects with similar visual properties.

# Cluster previews

Clusters are presented as preview cards to help users quickly grasp the structure of their data. Each cluster preview displays:

- **Number of items** – Total number of items that comply with the current filtering criteria.  
- **Prominent labels** – Ordered by most frequent image or object labels.  
- **Representing Images** – A selection of key images or Core Frames that visually summarize the cluster.

### Example of Cluster Previews

Clusters preview in **images view**:

Clusters preview in **Objects view** (Objects are cropped):

## Find similar:

When hovering over a cluster preview, you can quickly search for similar images or objects based on the selected view.  
For more details, visit **Visual Search**.

## Clustering granularity

The **Granularity knob** at the bottom right of the screen allows you to adjust the level of similarity that determines clustering.

<br />

Moving the knob to the **left** creates looser clusters (lower similarity threshold), grouping visually similar images and objects more broadly. _(This is the default setting)_

Moving the knob to the **right** applies stricter clustering (higher similarity threshold), ensuring that only highly similar images and objects are grouped together.
