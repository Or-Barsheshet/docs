    This feature enables teams to streamline repetitive or manual tasks, reducing time spent on video review and dataset cleanup. It’s particularly valuable for computer vision teams managing large-scale video datasets across multiple environments.

</Note>

Triggers determine **how and when** a Visual Layer workflow starts. Every published workflow must include a configured trigger to function properly.

[Choosing the right trigger type](/docs/workflows/triggers/overview) helps ensure your automation aligns with operational needs, while changing a trigger allows for flexibility as priorities shift.

<Note>
To learn more about how trigger types behave, visit the [Trigger Overview](/docs/workflows/triggers/overview). For help with setup, see documentation on each type: [on-demand](#on-demand-triggers), [event-based](#event-based-triggers), or [scheduled](#scheduled-triggers).
</Note>

## Choose or Change a Trigger Type

<Warning>
If you change a trigger type, **all existing trigger-specific settings will be erased** and cannot be recovered automatically.
</Warning>

Triggers can be configured during the workflow creation process—either via **Workflow Editor** or with assistance from **Visual Copilot**.

After selecting the trigger type, the next step is to configure it [based on the type](#related-articles) you chose.

<Note>

</Note>

**To change the trigger for an existing workflow:**

1. Navigate to [**Workflows**](/docs/workflows/editor) in the Visual Layer Console.

    The Workflows dashboard appears.

2. Open the desired project and select the workflow you'd like to edit.

    The workflow opens in the canvas view.

3. Hover over the current trigger and open the options menu (three dots).

    A dropdown appears, similar to the following image:

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/Automations/ChangeTriggers.gif" alt="Change trigger in workflow editor" />
</Frame>

4. Click **Change Trigger Type**.

    A selection panel opens, allowing you to choose a new type.

  <img src="/img/Automations/ChooseNewTrigger.gif" alt="Choose a new trigger type" />
</Frame>

5. Choose from the following supported trigger types:

<div className="integrations-table">

|   | Trigger Type | Description |
|---|--------------|-------------|
| <Icon icon="user-large" iconType="regular" /> | [On-demand triggers](/docs/workflows/triggers/on-demand) | Manually initiated via CLI, Slack, or the Visual Layer portal. |
| <Icon icon="bolt" iconType="regular" /> | [Event-based triggers](/docs/workflows/triggers/event-based) | Automatically triggered by system events, such as a dataset upload or webhook. |
| <Icon icon="clock" iconType="regular" /> | [Scheduled triggers](/docs/workflows/triggers/scheduled) | Run workflows at pre-defined intervals, e.g., hourly or weekly. |

</div>

6. Click **Apply**.

    The selected trigger is now active, and the workflow is updated accordingly.
